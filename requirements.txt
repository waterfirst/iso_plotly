# Streamlit ISO Polar Plot Visualization Requirements

# Core framework
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Data manipulation
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Visualization libraries
matplotlib>=3.6.0
plotly>=5.15.0

# Scientific computing and interpolation
scipy>=1.10.0

# Image processing (for Gaussian filtering)
# scipy already includes ndimage, so this is covered

# Additional utilities
# These are typically included with Python or covered by above packages:
# - io (built-in)
# - base64 (built-in)

# Font support for Korean text (optional, for better Korean font rendering)
# matplotlib already handles font fallback, but you might want to install additional fonts

# Version constraints explanation:
# - streamlit>=1.28.0: For latest features and stability
# - pandas>=1.5.0: For reliable data manipulation and CSV handling
# - numpy>=1.24.0: For numerical operations and array handling
# - matplotlib>=3.6.0: For plotting and Korean font support
# - plotly>=5.15.0: For interactive plots with latest features
# - scipy>=1.10.0: For interpolation functions (RegularGridInterpolator, Rbf, griddata)

# Optional: For better Korean font support on some systems
# matplotlib-fontconfig>=0.1.0

# Development dependencies (uncomment if needed for development)
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# ipython>=8.0.0
